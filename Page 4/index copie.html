      <p1>HAALAND : Spanish press get excited about Haaland (Dortmund)

It is hard to go three days without new information filtering through about the future of Erling Haaland. The highly-rated Borussia Dortmund striker has become an "affair of state" at Real Madrid, as revealed by the daily AS last week. On Tuesday, German newspaper Bild reported that his price had been set at €150m by Dortmund. However, on Saturday, Madrid newspaper ABC reported that talks were taking place at around €120m. Real are said to be optimistic given the 20-year-old's preference to continue his career at the Casa Blanca. Barcelona have not been deterred, however, with Catalan daily Sport reporting on the Norwegian. Joan Laporta, recently elected president after a first term in office between 2003 and 2010, is said to have contacted Haaland's entourage to warn that the doors to Barça are wide open. Credible? Not really from a financial point of view, as the club has been counting its money for several months.
